# Wimos
A Windows and MacOs customizable installer.
-this is currently still a work in progress.

# What is it supposed to become/do?
The idea is that it should be a costumizable installer that will scrape or get the latest version of a certain set of applications that you define. And it should work on Windows (priority 1) and MacOS (priority 2). 

First it will be focused on a command line installation. After that it will become a simple GUI which should auto determine or give the option for your operating system and it should scrape the packages you gave in to be installed.

# What does Wimos mean or stand for?
Windows installer & MacOS
-It does not escape me that it is not a creative name, but I used a random name generator and this was the only word that I liked.
